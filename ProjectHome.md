This is a code snippet that allows you to easily embed a telnet client/server into any application.

This is especially useful for debugging applications that do not have a pre-existing GUI interface.  Simply 'telnet' into the application and you can send commands to it.  You can also use it as a mechanism to perform extremely simple peer to peer communications between your applications.

Currently the source only builds for Windows and XBOX, though I am eager to get a Linux, Apple, and Iphone version working soon.
